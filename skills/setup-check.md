# Skill: setup-check

The first thing `program.md` runs. Validates `config.yaml`, verifies every referenced adapter file exists, and confirms every `*_env` environment variable is actually set before the inner loop touches anything. On any problem, surface a structured, actionable error to the human and stop. No degraded-mode startup on user errors.

Invoked by `program.md` step 1. Calls `harness/yaml_to_json.py`, `harness/validate.py`, and (for adapter capability validation) `skills/validate-adapter.md`.

## Why this exists

Without this skill, the inner loop would start with a silently-wrong config or a missing env var, producing confusing output hours into a run. The rule is: every failure mode must stop setup with a line-addressed message that tells the human WHAT is wrong, WHERE, and HOW to fix it.

## Steps

### 1. Confirm `config.yaml` exists

```
ls autoresearch-web/config.yaml
```

If missing, stop with:

```
SETUP CHECK FAILED: config.yaml not found
expected: autoresearch-web/config.yaml
fix: cp autoresearch-web/config.example.yaml autoresearch-web/config.yaml
     then edit it to set project.root, goal.event, goal.target_paths,
     and the adapter ids you want.
setup stopped.
```

### 2. Convert `config.yaml` to JSON and run schema validation

```bash
python3 autoresearch-web/harness/yaml_to_json.py autoresearch-web/config.yaml \
  | python3 autoresearch-web/harness/validate.py config --stdin
```

This runs two layers of checks:

- `yaml_to_json.py` parses the config with a minimal YAML subset parser (stdlib only). If the config uses unsupported YAML features, it stops with a clear line number.
- `validate.py config` runs the draft-07 schema from `harness/schemas/config.json` plus post-schema rules: weights sum ≈ 1.0, `discard < push`, and a literal-secret heuristic for `config.adapters.*`.

On any failure, exit code is 2 (user error) or 3 (load/parser error). Surface the stderr block verbatim to the human and stop. Exit code 4 (internal helper crash) is NOT the user's fault — log a warning in `run.log` and continue, but mark the config as "unvalidated" so later steps know to be cautious.

### 3. Verify adapter files exist for every non-null, non-fixture id

For each `config.adapters.<kind>.id` that is neither `null` nor `"fixture"`:

```
ls autoresearch-web/adapters/<kind>/<id>.md
```

Missing file → stop with:

```
SETUP CHECK FAILED: adapter file not found
config.adapters.<kind>.id = "<id>"
expected: autoresearch-web/adapters/<kind>/<id>.md
exists: no
fix: either (a) set adapters.<kind>.id: null in config.yaml to run without that data source,
            (b) run skills/author-adapter.md to create it, or
            (c) git pull — the reference adapter may not be checked in yet.
setup stopped.
```

### 4. Parse each loaded adapter's `requires.env` list and verify the vars are set

For each adapter file loaded in step 3, read its `requires` block (the YAML frontmatter inside `## requires`) and for every name in `env`, check `os.environ`:

```bash
python3 -c 'import os, sys; print("SET" if os.environ.get(sys.argv[1]) else "MISSING")' VAR_NAME
```

Or, equivalently, the agent can check its own environment. A missing env var stops setup with:

```
SETUP CHECK FAILED: required env var not set
adapter: autoresearch-web/adapters/<kind>/<id>.md
missing: <VAR_NAME>
declared at: adapters/<kind>/<id>.md :: requires.env
fix: export <VAR_NAME>=<value>
     then re-run program.md setup.
setup stopped.
```

If `config.mode: fixture` is set, skip this check — fixture mode is supposed to run without real credentials. Note the skip in `run.log`.

### 5. Run `skills/validate-adapter.md` against each loaded adapter

For each non-null adapter, invoke `skills/validate-adapter.md` with the adapter path and the current `config.mode`. That skill runs each declared capability once (against live APIs or fixture data, per mode) and pipes the response to `harness/validate.py` to confirm the returned shape matches the contract.

Failure → stop setup with the full error block from validate.py's stderr. See `skills/validate-adapter.md` for the exact error format and what it tells the human about fixing the adapter's `## read` section.

### 6. Validate `workflow` config (if present)

If `config.workflow` is set, run these checks. The first three are hard failures; the rest are warnings.

**a) Auto-push threshold floor (hard).** If `workflow.auto_push_threshold < prevalidation.thresholds.push`, stop with:

```
SETUP CHECK FAILED: workflow.auto_push_threshold is below the push gate
config.workflow.auto_push_threshold = <value>
config.prevalidation.thresholds.push = <push>
fix: set auto_push_threshold >= <push>. Auto mode is supposed to be
     MORE selective than the base push gate, not less.
setup stopped.
```

**b) Auto mode requires an abtest adapter (hard).** If `workflow.review_mode == "auto"` and `adapters.abtest.id` is `null`, stop with:

```
SETUP CHECK FAILED: auto mode with no abtest adapter
config.workflow.review_mode = "auto"
config.adapters.abtest.id = null
fix: either (a) set review_mode to "manual" or "off", or
            (b) author an abtest adapter via skills/author-adapter.md and set
                adapters.abtest.id to its filename.
setup stopped.
```

**c) Auto allocation must be live (hard).** If `workflow.review_mode == "auto"` and `workflow.auto_allocation_pct < 1`, stop with:

```
SETUP CHECK FAILED: auto mode with 0% allocation
config.workflow.review_mode = "auto"
config.workflow.auto_allocation_pct = <value>
fix: auto mode pushes tests live. Set auto_allocation_pct to the
     traffic % you want the test to run at (default 50 = even split
     with control). If you want the 0% staging flow where the human
     ramps traffic manually, use review_mode: "manual" instead.
setup stopped.
```

**d) Test-window floor (warning + clamp).** Compute `test_window_hours = test_window.value * (24 | 168 | 730)`. If `test_window_hours < outer_loop.min_experiment_hours`, warn and clamp upward:

```
WARNING: workflow.test_window resolves to <Nh>, which is below the
outer_loop.min_experiment_hours floor (<Mh>). Clamping test_window
to <Mh>. Either raise workflow.test_window or lower
outer_loop.min_experiment_hours to silence this warning.
```

**e) Abtest adapter must accept `allocation_pct` (hard in auto mode, warning in manual).** Parse the abtest adapter file and confirm its `## write :: push_variant` section accepts an `allocation_pct` argument per `adapters/README.md`. If the adapter hardcodes the allocation:
- `review_mode == "auto"` → stop with "adapter does not accept allocation_pct; auto mode cannot honor auto_allocation_pct". Set the fix hint to "upgrade the adapter to take allocation_pct, or switch to manual mode".
- Otherwise → warn but continue; in manual mode all pushes are 0% and the hardcoded adapter will still work.

**f) Auto-apply warning (advisory).** If `workflow.auto_apply_to_repo == true`, print:

```
WARNING: workflow.auto_apply_to_repo is true.
The agent will commit patches directly to <config.project.root> without
human review of each patch. Ensure:
  - config.guardrails.deny_globs covers all sensitive paths.
  - config.workflow.auto_apply_threshold (<value>) is high enough.
  - config.git.use_branch is set to your preferred branch strategy.
Proceed only if you have reviewed these settings.
```

**g) Phase 2/3 prevalidation helpers must exist (hard).** If `prevalidation.lighthouse.enabled == true`, confirm `harness/lighthouse.sh` and `harness/apply-patch.sh` exist. If `prevalidation.persona.enabled == true`, confirm `harness/persona-sim.md` and the configured `prevalidation.persona.personas_file` exist. Missing any of these stops setup with:

```
SETUP CHECK FAILED: Phase 2/3 prevalidation helper not shipped
enabled flag: prevalidation.<lighthouse|persona>.enabled = true
missing file: <path>
fix: these helpers are opt-in and not yet shipped with the framework.
     Either (a) set the matching prevalidation.<phase>.enabled flag to
     false, or (b) author the helper yourself. The MVP runs zero-dep
     with llm_judge + heuristic signals only.
setup stopped.
```

**h) Schedule echo.** If `schedule.enabled == true`, echo the schedule back to the human as confirmation:

```
schedule: enabled — will prompt for cron setup (every <interval_value> <interval_unit>).
```

Schema already enforces the valid value ranges; the echo is purely for human visibility.

### 7. Confirm success

If all steps pass, write one line to `run.log`:

```
{"ts": "<ISO-8601>", "event": "setup_check_passed", "adapter": null, "capability": null, "files_read": <n>, "files_written": 1, "notes": "config.yaml and all enabled adapters validated"}
```

And tell the human:

```
setup-check passed: config.yaml OK, adapters validated ({n_adapters} enabled, {n_null} null), env vars set.
```

Then return control to `program.md` for the remaining setup steps.

## What this skill must NOT do

- **Do not edit `config.yaml`.** If a value is wrong, the human fixes it — the skill only reports.
- **Do not prompt the human for missing env vars.** Stop with an actionable error and let the human set them before re-running.
- **Do not guess at adapter ids.** If the file is missing, say so; don't silently fall back.
- **Do not skip a step on exit code 4.** Exit 4 is a helper crash; log a warning but flag the config as unvalidated — do not continue as if nothing happened.
- **Do not run the inner loop.** This skill is pure validation. `program.md` handles loop orchestration.

## Fixture mode note

When `config.mode: fixture`:

- Step 4 (env var check) is skipped — fixture adapters don't need credentials.
- Step 5 (validate-adapter) runs each capability against the fixture file's pre-shaped data via the adapter's `## fallbacks` `mode: fixture` branch. This proves both the adapter AND the fixture agree on the normalized shape, which is the whole point of fixture-mode validation.

If fixture mode fails validation, the bug is almost always in the adapter's `## read` section, the fixture sample file, or the schema — in that order.
