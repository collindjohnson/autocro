# Skill: pre-validate

Score a generated variant across the enabled signals and write a single composite to `variants/<slug>/pre-validation.json`.

## Inputs

- A variant folder at `variants/<slug>/` containing `hypothesis.md` and `patch.diff`.
- `config.prevalidation` with enabled signals, weights, and thresholds.
- `harness/judge-rubric.md`.
- The parent project's HEAD (for context when scoring the patch).

## Output

Write `variants/<slug>/pre-validation.json` in this shape:

```json

  "slug": "v0042-pricing-cta-specificity",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-10T02:14:05Z",

    "heuristic": 0.273,
    "llm_judge": 0.727
  },
  "composite": 0.375
}
```

Return the composite score to the inner loop as a single float.

## Heuristic signal (zero-dep, deterministic)

Run these checks against the patch and the patched file contents (apply the patch mentally or via a scratch read — do NOT mutate the user's working tree). Each sub-score is in `[-1, +1]`. Average them and map back to `[-1, +1]` for the heuristic signal score.

### 1. CTA verb quality (`cta_verb_quality`)

Look for `<a>`, `<button>`, or click-handler text changed in the diff. Score:

- **+1.0**: task-specific action verb naming the outcome ("Start free trial", "Create account", "Get instant demo", "Download report")
- **+0.5**: strong action verb without specificity ("Get started", "Try it free")
- **+0.0**: neutral ("Continue", "Next", "Sign up")
- **−0.5**: vague ("Learn more", "Click here", "Read more")
- **−1.0**: made worse or new vague CTA introduced

If the diff does not touch a CTA, set `cta_verb_quality` to `null` and exclude from the average.

### 2. Readability grade (`readability_grade`)

Extract copy changes from the diff. Compute Flesch-Kincaid grade on the NEW copy and the OLD copy. Score:

- **+1.0**: grade dropped by ≥ 3 (copy got easier) AND new grade ≤ 9
- **+0.5**: grade dropped by ≥ 1
- **+0.0**: ±1 grade change
- **−0.5**: grade rose by ≥ 1
- **−1.0**: grade rose by ≥ 3 OR new grade ≥ 14

If no copy changes, set to `null`.

### 3. Social proof presence (`social_proof_presence`)

Does the diff add/remove quantified social proof ("4,200 companies", "★ 4.9 from 3,100 reviews", named customer logos)?

- **+1.0**: adds new quantified social proof
- **+0.5**: strengthens existing (e.g., adds a number to an existing mention)
- **+0.0**: no change
- **−0.5**: removes some
- **−1.0**: removes all

### 4. Contrast ratio (`contrast_ratio`)

If the diff touches CSS colors or text-on-background pairs, compute WCAG contrast ratio (or use the `accesslint:contrast-checker` skill if available). Score:

- **+1.0**: raises contrast from failing (< 4.5:1 for body text, < 3:1 for large) to passing
- **+0.5**: raises passing contrast further
- **+0.0**: no change
- **−0.5**: lowers passing contrast while staying above threshold
- **−1.0**: drops below WCAG AA threshold

If no color changes, set to `null`.

### 5. Form friction (`form_friction`)

Count form fields before and after the diff. Score:

- **+1.0**: removes ≥ 2 required fields without losing meaningful data
- **+0.5**: removes 1 required field, or makes required → optional
- **+0.0**: no change
- **−0.5**: adds 1 field
- **−1.0**: adds ≥ 2 fields or makes optional → required

If no form changes, set to `null`.

### 6. Mobile viewport meta (`mobile_viewport_meta`)

Does the patched HTML have `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` on target pages? +1 if it was missing and is now present; 0 if unchanged (present or irrelevant); −1 if removed.

### Aggregation

```
enabled = [s for s in sub_scores if s is not null]
heuristic_score = mean(enabled) if len(enabled) > 0 else 0.0
```

## LLM judge signal (zero-dep, panel-averaged)

Invoke the rubric in `harness/judge-rubric.md` once per panel pass (default 5 passes). Each pass gets a fresh prompt that includes:

1. The full contents of `harness/judge-rubric.md`.
2. The hypothesis from `hypothesis.md`.
3. The diff from `patch.diff`.
4. The relevant "before" content from the parent project.
5. The seed from `config.prevalidation.llm_judge.seed` (used as a salt in the rubric instructions to reduce variance).

Each pass must return a single float in `[-1, +1]`. Store the raw panel array in `signals.llm_judge.raw_panel`. The signal score is the panel mean.

If any pass returns something outside `[-1, +1]` or non-numeric, clamp to the range and add a note to `signals.llm_judge.notes`.

Set `is_stochastic: false` — the rubric + seed combination is designed to be quasi-deterministic across runs.

## Lighthouse signal (Phase 2, opt-in)

If `config.prevalidation.lighthouse.enabled` is true:

1. `skills/setup-check.md` step 6g is expected to have already confirmed that `harness/lighthouse.sh` and `harness/apply-patch.sh` exist; if this skill is invoked with lighthouse enabled and either helper is missing, stop with an error pointing back at setup-check. Also confirm Node is available.
2. Create a scratch worktree at `~/.cache/autoresearch-web/worktrees/<slug>/`.
3. Apply `patch.diff` there via `harness/apply-patch.sh`.
4. Serve or navigate to `config.project.baseline_url` in that worktree.
5. Run `harness/lighthouse.sh <url>` and parse the JSON for the configured categories.
6. Compute delta vs a cached baseline score (cache at `~/.cache/autoresearch-web/baseline-lighthouse.json`, refresh weekly).
7. Map each category delta to `[-1, +1]` (a 10-point Lighthouse delta ≈ 0.5 signal score).
8. Average across categories for the signal score.
9. Tear down the worktree.

If Lighthouse fails, set `signals.lighthouse.enabled: false` for this variant and add a note.

## Persona signal (Phase 3, opt-in)

If `config.prevalidation.persona.enabled` is true, follow `harness/persona-sim.md`. Set `is_stochastic: true`.

## Composite calculation

```
enabled_signals = [s for s in signals if signals[s].enabled]
weight_sum = sum(config.prevalidation.weights[s] for s in enabled_signals)
for s in enabled_signals:
    renormalized[s] = config.prevalidation.weights[s] / weight_sum

composite = sum(signals[s].score * renormalized[s] for s in enabled_signals)
```

Clamp composite to `[-1, +1]` as a final safety.

## Write the file

Write `variants/<slug>/pre-validation.json` with the full shape shown at the top. Return the composite float to the inner loop.

## Do not

- Do not mutate `patch.diff` from this skill.
- Do not apply the patch to the parent's working tree.
- Do not update `results.tsv` from this skill — the inner loop writes the row.
- Do not ask the human to pick a score or break a tie. Compute deterministically.
