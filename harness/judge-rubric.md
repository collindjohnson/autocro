# Judge rubric

Used by `skills/pre-validate.md` to score a variant's LLM-judge signal. Each panel pass (default 5) reads this full rubric, the variant's hypothesis, the variant's `patch.diff`, the relevant "before" content from the parent project, and a seed. Each pass returns a single float in `[-1, +1]`.

The rubric emphasizes **concrete, checkable properties** and **explicitly penalizes AI-fluff copy** so the composite score doesn't drift into "an LLM that loves what LLMs write" territory.

## How to run a single panel pass

Given:
- `hypothesis.md`
- `patch.diff`
- The "before" files from the parent project (so you can compare)
- A seed (`config.prevalidation.llm_judge.seed`, default `42`)

Return a single JSON object:

```json
{
  "items": {
    "cta_clarity":       {"score": 1, "reason": "..."},
    "cta_specificity":   {"score": 1, "reason": "..."},
    "value_prop_concrete":{"score": 0, "reason": "..."},
    "friction_reduction":{"score": 1, "reason": "..."},
    "social_proof_real": {"score": 0, "reason": "..."},
    "copy_concreteness": {"score": 1, "reason": "..."},
    "copy_antifluff":    {"score": 0, "reason": "..."},
    "visual_hierarchy":  {"score": 0, "reason": "..."},
    "mobile_first":      {"score": 0, "reason": "..."},
    "accessibility":     {"score": 0, "reason": "..."}
  },
  "composite": 0.4,
  "seed": 42,
  "notes": "..."
}
```

Each `items.*.score` is one of `-1`, `0`, `+1`. The `composite` is the mean of all items, mapped to `[-1, +1]`.

## The items

Score each item independently. For each, output `-1` (worse than baseline), `0` (neutral or not applicable), or `+1` (clearly improved). Give a one-sentence `reason` citing a specific line or element from the diff.

### 1. CTA clarity

Does the patched primary CTA clearly describe what happens when the user clicks it, in 5 words or fewer?

- `+1`: "Start free trial", "Create my account", "Download the 2026 report", "Get instant demo"
- `0`: "Continue", "Next step", "Sign up", existing good CTAs unchanged
- `-1`: "Learn more", "Read more", "Click here", "Get started" (without specificity), new vague CTAs introduced

### 2. CTA specificity

Does the CTA name the specific outcome (free trial, account, demo, report name, etc.) rather than a generic action?

- `+1`: names the thing ("Start 14-day trial", "Download state of AI 2026")
- `0`: generic but active ("Start now", "Get the guide")
- `-1`: abstract or passive ("Learn", "Explore", "Discover")

### 3. Value prop concreteness

Does the patch make the value proposition more specific, quantified, or outcome-oriented?

- `+1`: replaces a vague benefit with a number, timeframe, or named outcome ("Ship 3× faster" → "Deploy in under 5 minutes")
- `0`: unchanged or still abstract
- `-1`: makes it vaguer, more adjective-heavy ("amazing", "revolutionary", "cutting-edge")

### 4. Friction reduction

Does the patch reduce the number of steps, clicks, or required form fields to reach the goal?

- `+1`: removes a required field, removes a step, defaults a sensible value, auto-fills from context
- `0`: no change to friction
- `-1`: adds a step, adds a required field, adds a confirmation dialog, adds a captcha

### 5. Social proof realism

Does the patch add or strengthen concrete, quantified, third-party social proof — not "trusted by leading companies" but actual numbers, logos, or verified testimonials?

- `+1`: adds real numbers ("4,200 companies", "★ 4.9 from 3,100 reviews"), named customer logos, or attributed testimonials
- `0`: unchanged, or adds generic trust language without numbers
- `-1`: adds unquantified/vague claims ("loved by customers", "trusted worldwide") OR removes existing concrete proof

### 6. Copy concreteness

Does the patched copy use specific nouns, verbs, and numbers instead of abstractions?

- `+1`: uses concrete nouns ("the invoice", "your team", "customers in 40 countries") and active verbs
- `0`: mixed
- `-1`: uses abstract nouns ("solutions", "experiences", "capabilities"), passive voice, or nominalizations ("enablement", "facilitation", "optimization")

### 7. Copy anti-fluff

Is the patch free of AI-generated-sounding marketing fluff?

- `+1`: Zero fluff. Every sentence could appear in a human-written technical blog post.
- `0`: One or two soft phrases, but not dominant.
- `-1`: Contains any of these common fluff phrases (deduct one point each, floor at `-1`):
  - "unlock your potential"
  - "take X to the next level"
  - "game-changing", "revolutionary", "cutting-edge"
  - "seamlessly integrate"
  - "empower your team"
  - "supercharge"
  - "leverage" (as a verb meaning "use")
  - "in today's fast-paced world"
  - "at the end of the day"
  - "world-class", "best-in-class"
  - "transform your X"
  - "elevate your X"
  - "drive meaningful outcomes"
  - "in this digital age"

**This item is the most important.** AI-written copy loses trust immediately. A +1 on every other item cannot save a patch that scores -1 here.

### 8. Visual hierarchy

If the patch changes layout, typography, or color, does it improve how quickly the eye finds the primary action?

- `+1`: primary CTA becomes more prominent (larger, brighter, better contrast, more whitespace around it) OR de-cluttering reduces competing elements
- `0`: no layout change, or changes are lateral
- `-1`: primary CTA becomes less prominent, or visual noise increases

### 9. Mobile-first

Is the change mobile-friendly? Would it render acceptably on a 375px-wide screen?

- `+1`: explicit mobile improvement (responsive classes, smaller font on small, stacked layout)
- `0`: no impact on mobile
- `-1`: uses fixed widths, desktop-only assumptions (hover states as the only affordance), or breaks responsive layout

### 10. Accessibility

Does the change maintain or improve accessibility (alt text, semantic HTML, ARIA roles, focus order, color contrast, keyboard navigation)?

- `+1`: adds alt text, semantic elements, aria labels, or improves contrast / focus
- `0`: no accessibility impact
- `-1`: uses divs where semantic elements belong, removes alt text, introduces low-contrast pairings, or breaks keyboard navigation

## Composite calculation

```
composite = sum(item.score for item in items) / count(items)
```

With 10 items each scored `-1`, `0`, or `+1`, composite is in `[-1, +1]` with granularity `0.1`.

**Clamp rule**: if `copy_antifluff` is `-1`, the overall composite is clamped to `min(composite, 0.0)` — a fluffy patch cannot score positive overall no matter how good the rest is.

## Seed usage

The seed is included in this prompt so repeated passes are quasi-deterministic. Use it to stabilize any tie-breaking between equal-score items: if two items are borderline, bias the decision by the parity of the seed. This is hand-wavy by design — the goal is to reduce variance across the 5-pass panel, not achieve perfect determinism.

## Anti-patterns to call out in `notes`

If the patch exhibits any of these, mention them explicitly in the `notes` field so the human can see why a panel pass scored low:

- "Commented-out old code left in."
- "Uses `!important` instead of fixing CSS specificity."
- "Introduces a new component for a one-line change."
- "Adds a hook / effect / observer to do what inline JSX could do."
- "Misspelled word in visible copy."
- "Broken link or placeholder href (`#`, `javascript:void`)."
- "Debug statement left in (`console.log`, `alert`, `TODO`)."

These are hints to `skills/simplicity-review.md` which may auto-discard.
